title: "About Me"
---

Someone asked me a few years ago: "So, what's your story?" The question left me struggling for an answer. I didn't feel like reciting my CV because, quite simply, that wasn't "my story". Yet, it seemed that that was precisely what I was being asked. A "What do you do?" phrased in a slightly more exciting way. I don't remember what my answer ended up being. I do know that the question about "my story" kept my mind busy for a few years until I started to understand that I didn't want to find a simple, conversation-style answer. Everyone's story is complex; too many layers, too many threads to merge into a 60 seconds introduction. 

Many of these layers are not something to share online. Some of those that are and that form at least part of my story are:

- I'm a woman.
- I'm a mother.
- I'm a sister and a daughter.
- I'm a partner.
- I grew up in a smaller town and have moved a lot, within Germany, the U.S., Switzerland and some other places.
- I was fortunate enough to see quite a lot of the world.
- I'm a researcher.
- I'm a democrat (not referring to the American political party here).
- I'm a generalist wanting to be a specialist who will never fully be a specialist.
- I'm political, believing in the power of every single individual to be able to drive change.
